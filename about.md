# About Me

I've been a software developer working on a contract basis for over 20 years. I started off as a wanna be musician then for some reason I started to like mathematics and ended up doing a PhD in it! After a year as a research assistant at university I moved into software development.

If it's windy I will likely be windsurfing. That's because I'm a bit crazy about windsurfing. As most windsurfers will tell you it's a lifelong addiction. If it's not windy I'll be messing about in the waves on a paddle board and if there are no waves I'll probably be trying not to hurt myself going slowly on a mountain bike somewhere.

When I'm able to I don't work the usual office hours. That's how I manage to do the outdoor stuff as well.

The best time to catch me is in the morning (any day of the week) or in the evening.
