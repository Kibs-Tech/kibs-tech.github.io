<div style=" margin-right:10px:"><img src="/avatar.jpg" class="avatar" /></div>

My name is Helen. I've been a software developer working on a contract basis for over 25 years. I started off as a wanna be musician then for some reason I started to like Mathematics and ended up doing a PhD in it! After a year as a research fellow at University I moved into software development. I'm also crazy about windsurfing.
