<div style="display:flex">
<div style=" margin-right:10px:"><img src="/avatar.jpg" class="avatar" /></div>

My name is Helen. I've been an enterprise software developer working on a contract basis for over 25 years. I have held both team lead and tech lead positions. I started off as a mathematician having done a PhD in mathematics. After some time in acedemic research I moved into software development. I'm also crazy about windsurfing.
