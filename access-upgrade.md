# Upgrading Microsoft Access

It's not unusual for a business to still be using an Access database application that they first had developed 15-20 years ago. If they are still running it in an earlier version of Access eg 2003, 2007 then they really should be thinking about upgrading it to the latest version.

## Some reasons to upgrade

- Databases become corrupt over time
- Databases slow down over time
- Windows 10 does not support older versions of Access which can lead to strange behavior and frustrating intermittent problems.
- It's a security risk. Your unsupported database cannot be updated with the latest security patches which leaves it very vulnerable to attack.  
- Once you've upgraded your Access database you will have options to further modernise your setup and make your data securely available to tablets, mobile and web apps.

## How much does upgrading it cost

The average cost for me to upgrade an MS Access application is just £300.
