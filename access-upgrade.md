## Upgrade to Microsoft 365 on Windows 10

It's not unusual for a business to still be using an Access database application that they first had developed 15-20 years ago. If they are still running it in an earlier version of Access eg 2003, 2007 then they really should think about upgrading it to the latest version.

## Some reasons to upgrade

- Databases become corrupt over time
- Databases slow down over time
- Windows 10 does not support older versions of Access which can lead to strange behavior and frustrating intermittent problems and crashes.
- It's a security risk. Your unsupported database cannot be updated with the latest security patches which leaves it very vulnerable to attack.
- It will make your Access database fit for the future and keep it running for many more years.  
- Once you've upgraded you will have further options to modernise your setup. For example you could make the data securely available to tablets, mobile and web apps opening up new revenue streams. This is another service that I offer (Further reading: [Microsoft Access and the Cloud](/articles/microsoft-access-and-the-cloud) ).

## Upgrading it yourself

If you're up to the challenge then by all means try upgrading the application yourself. It may turn out to be pretty straight forward. A useful best practice guide for performing a Microsoft Access upgrade can be found <a href="/articles/upgrading-ms-access-database" target="_blank" alt="How to upgrade a microsoft access database">here</a>. If you're not sure about it or know you need help then contact me for a free assessment of your application. I'd love to see it!

## How much does upgrading cost

It need not be expensive. Some clients of mine have previously been quoted thousands but thankfully they looked elsewhere! All Access applications are different and how much an upgrade costs depends on the size and complexity of the application.  I will need to look at it first and then I'll give you a quote.
