# Reasons why Small Business should move to the Cloud


This idea is evolving subject to market research. At first the idea was a rather generic “to provide development support to businesses that have legacy bespoke software whilst also guiding them along a structured path to modernisation which is sympathetic and mindful of costs”. But that is too broad a scope. Really, at the heart of the sort of legacy systems that I am seeking to modernise is a database and the simplest yet most effective step to modernising such legacy systems is to upgrade the database  and then shift it into the cloud. the FE applications can continue to work as they do now but the database is now in the cloud which opens up a whole new world of opportunities for the business to make that data work for them and gives them access to application services which support all manner of devices including of course mobile.
