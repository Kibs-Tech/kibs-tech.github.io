# Move your database into the cloud

If, at the heart of your business software system there is a database and its sitting in your office somewhere its time to move it into the cloud. If its an old database running on an old operating system then its time to upgrade it and then move it into the cloud.

'the simplest yet most effective way to modernise a legacy system is to upgrade the database to the latest version and then shift it into the cloud'

A database can be split into two parts. The backend and the frontend. The frontend is the part that users interact with. It is all the forms, reports and queries. The backend is the actual database engine and it is the backend that can be put into the cloud leaving the frontend working as it does now.

## Reasons to move your database into the cloud

### Instantly modernises your business

When you move your data into the cloud it opens up a whole new world of opportunities for your business to make that data work for you. For example you will have access to the same business applications that the big boys have. Your data will also become accessible to your team anytime, from anywhere and on any device thus promoting true collaboration.  

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

When the database is in the cloud, the cloud provider has systems in place that guard against hardware failure. Similarly, the cloud providers perform routine backups. ll this means you don't have to worry about hard disk failures and backing up your database all the time.

### Better Security and Automatic Updates

The cloud provider takes care of all software updates  and security patches. This means your database is always up to date with latest security measures.

If you've got an old database running on an old unsupported operating system like Windows XP then it is unprotected from modern day viruses and hacker attacks.

### No longer need a server

 You don't need a computer on all the time with your database installed in it (a server). the database ius happily living in the cloud and you don't have to worry about it. In fact the pay as you go model that cloud providers use will likely be much kinder to your cash flow.

. the FE applications can continue to work as they do now but the database is now in the cloud which opens up a whole new world of opportunities for the business to make that data work for them and gives them access to application services which support all manner of devices including of course mobile.
