# Move your database into the cloud

If at the heart of your business software system there is a database and its sitting in your office somewhere then its time to move it into the cloud. The simplest yet most effective way to modernise a legacy system is to upgrade the database to the latest version and then shift it into the cloud.

## The most exciting reason for moving a database into the cloud

When you move your database into the cloud it opens up a whole new world of opportunities for your business and allows your business to make your precious data really work for you. Your front end applications will continue to work as they do now but  your data will also become accessible to your team anytime, from anywhere and on any device thus promoting true collaboration. The data also becomes available to web and mobile apps. Furthermore you will have access to the same business application services that the big boys have.  

## Other reasons for moving your database into the cloud

### Less need for database administration

This is especially true if you opt for a managed database instance which means that most of the technical administrative duties including performance tuning are taken care of for you.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

When the database is in the cloud, the cloud provider has systems in place that guard against hardware failure. Similarly, the cloud providers perform routine backups. This means you don't have to worry about hard disk failures and backing up your database all the time.

### Better Security and Automatic Updates

The cloud provider takes care of all software updates  and security patches. Therefore your database is always up to date with latest security measures.

### No longer need a server

 You don't need an expensive computer on all the time with your database installed on it. Instead the database is happily living in the cloud and you don't have to worry about it. Furthermore if you opt for the pay as you go model that cloud providers offer the cloud hosting will likely be much kinder to your cash flow.
