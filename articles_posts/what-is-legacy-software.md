# What is Legacy Software?

ME:
Much has been written about modernising legacy systems from the perspective of large businnesses and enterprises but what about small businesses. If small businesses are usig out of the box sofware like microsoft office an they have access to IT support then chances are they have upgraded their version of windows and Office along the way. The problem of legacy software exists for businesses who had custom software developed for them years ago and now theyre more or less stuck using that same software which is well past its expiry date. To make matters worse that sofware probably only runs on long obsolete versions of Windows.

Legacy software is an application that is no longer updated or supported by the developer. Software also becomes legacy if the developer is no longer in business.

Legacy applications start to break intermittently and as the frequency of breakdowns increases, so does the time required to get things  working again. 


You can put a hold on  modernization but there is always a need to add something new to your softwares capabilities or to fix issues. This is where legacy software becomes a bottleneck and expensive because making even minor changes to legacy software becomes problematic and hence expensive.

This is especially important for small businesses because the longer you use old systems, the more of your budget is invested in keeping it alive, taking you to the point where maintenance will be more expensive than an actual upgrade.

Don’t ditch your legacy systems, modernize them.

## Main reasons to upgrade

In summary you will stop wasting money on supporting old and ineffective systems, increase security,  become mobile compatible, cut costs on  maintenance and eliminate bottlenecks in your company’s growth potential.

**Is it suitable for my business?**
Modernisation is suitable for any industry of any size that uses IT technologies: from small applications running on Windows to massive and sophisticated enterprise systems.

### Demotivated employees

Research has found that for 38% of workers, their happiness at work impacts their performance. And with more than half of UK employees dissatisfied with workplace technology, it’s clear that outdated, obsolete, and hard-to-use systems are affecting staff morale.

### Vulnerable to security attacks

When support for a software system ceases it becomes vulnerable to  security threats. There have been plenty of reports on malware attacks and data breaches and those situations could be easily avoided if companies replaced their legacy software This is because it can no longer receive security patches and updates which are basically what keeps software alive and well. As you can imagine, it is impossible for software from the early 2000s to detect modern day viruses and hacker attacks.    incompatibility with the latest security innovations and authentication methods.

### You can’t access it from mobile devices

Most business applications are now web-based, paid for monthly and built to be compatible on a huge range of devices. 

If the software you rely on most regularly can’t be easily accessed on smartphones and tablets, you’ll be missing significant opportunities to boost the productivity of your workforce. You may also be paying over the odds for software licenses if they are tied to particular computers.

### You’re having to maintain a server

If your business software relies on a dedicated server that you purchased ten years ago and that carries its own maintenance contract, it’s time to look for alternatives.

### Increasing maintenance costs

Microsoft reported that the cost of a PC running on Windows 10 is approximately £168 per year.  If you stick to Windows XP they calculated it could be as high as £780 per year. That is just for one PC. You can reasonably expect that the price gap will become bigger with time. Legacy software costs

## Two approaches to modernisation

### Rebuild and replace

This approach involves taking out the legacy system altogether and replacing it with a new one.

### Modernization in stages

This approach to modernisation keeps your business running without any downtime or serious risks.
