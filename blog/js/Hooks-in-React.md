Im not going to write a tutorial on how to use hooks. This is a blog not a set of tutorials and as with everything else programming related these days there are gazillions of tutorials out there.

Instead I'm just going to say Yahoooo!!!!

Well I'll also say that once you start using React Hooks you will suddenly find that your now 'legacy' code base looks absolutely terrible. 

Do not look at it. Ignore it. Its been tested. Its stable. It works. Do not change it.

Ok perhaps stick a re-write at the bottom of the technical debt list.
