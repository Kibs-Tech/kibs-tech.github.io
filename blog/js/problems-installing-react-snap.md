When installing react-snap there is an error:

Error: Chromium revision is not downloaded

The error information centers around issues with puppeteer. 

Save yourself hours of googling and trying out all the different suggested fixes and work arounds and just install [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) instead. It does the same thing.
