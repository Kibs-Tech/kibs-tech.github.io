# React Boostrap Nav is BAD for SEO

## Why do I make such a claim?

Well the dropdowns are javascript meaning there are no links in the html therefore Google ain't gonna find your pages. Just view the source code. Bad React Bootstrap.

## Solution

Simplest: Any pages linked to in the dropdown navs that are SEO important should also be linked to elsewhere so the bots can find the pages.
