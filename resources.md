## Cloud hosting providers

[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Google have a generous free tier which will suffice for many small web apps and API hosting. Firebase is well suited to mobile app development. It also provides all manner of modern day authentication which can save a developer quite a lot of work. Naturally encourages serverless approach.

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - most people have heard of Amazon Web Services or AWS these days. It is complicated though and very much geared towards Enterprise and hi tech teams.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - easy to use cloud platform but strangely expensive

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) - my favourite. Offers low cost, easy to use cloud hosting with a fixed monthly payment model so you know how much everything is going to cost you. They provide one click deployment of all manner of tech stacks such as NodeJS and LAMP.

## Managed database hosting

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) - very affordable MySQL or PostgreSQL hosting.

[Scale Grid](https://www.digitalocean.com) - ScaleGrid will manage your MySQL, PostgreSQL or NoSQL Mongoose database hosted on either Azure, AWS, GCP (Google) or DigitalOcean.

[Compose](https://www.compose.com/pricing#postgresql) - an IBM company but is still affordable. Also suited to enterprise level.

## Modern alternatives to MS Access

The following are modern alternatives to MS Access. They are no code application builders which are web based and facilitate the rapid deployment of cloud based data centric web and mobile apps. The down side is they completely tie you into the provider so they are not for everybody.
