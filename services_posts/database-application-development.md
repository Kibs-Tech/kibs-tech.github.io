# <i class="fa fa-database icon-db" ></i> Database application development

All development work and programming of existing database applications undertaken.  We have worked on applications built on MS Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and Oracle.

## Old database applications
We are happy to work with old database applications too. Whether it be an  MS Access desktop application running on Windows XP or an old browser based admin panel accessing an MySQL server,  we'll keep developing them, fixing issues, adding new features,  reports, queries etc. However we will encourage you to upgrade the database to the latest version and once we've done that we'll talk to you about modernising your system and securing your data by moving it to the cloud.
