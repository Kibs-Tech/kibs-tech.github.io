# <i class="fa fa-database icon-db" ></i> Database Application Development

All development work and programming of existing database applications undertaken.  I have worked on many database applications built on MS Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and Oracle.

## Older database applications

I am happy to work with older database applications. Whether it is an older MS Access desktop application or an old browser based admin application accessing an MySQL server,  I can keep developing them, fixing issues and adding new features. I will however encourage you to upgrade the database to the latest version and once you've done that I'll talk to you about modernising your system and moving your data to the cloud.

## Special database application services
