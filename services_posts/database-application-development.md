# <i class="fa fa-database icon-db" ></i> Database Application Development

All development work and programming of existing database applications seriously considered.  I have worked on many database applications built on MS Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and Oracle.

## Older database applications

I am happy to work with older database applications too. Whether it is an  MS Access desktop application running on Windows XP or an old browser based admin panel accessing an MySQL server,  I can keep developing them, fixing issues and adding new features, reports and queries etc. I will however encourage you to upgrade the database to the latest version (and the operating system) and once you've done that I'll talk to you about modernising your system and securing your data by moving it to the cloud.
