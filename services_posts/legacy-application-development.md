# <i class="far fa-save icon-legacy" ></i> Legacy Application Development

Legacy is any software that is no longer supported by the original developer. Legacy also means old as in it looks old and dated which is particularly painful to see with websites.

I am happy to work with legacy software. I have many years of experience in getting into software that doesn't have any documentation and working out how it's all coded. The biggest challenge usually is working out how to rebuild the software and install it. Once I've done that, it's not long before I can start fixing issues and making changes to it.

## Modernising legacy software

Legacy systems exists in all businesses and enterprises and how to modernise them is a major ongoing problem. Many enterprises are ripping out old software that took years to develop and are starting again using modern cloud based software architectures. Smaller businesses with a more considered budget are, when it's possible, taking a step by step approach to modernisation of their software systems. 

For a legacy system that has a database at its heart, the simplest yet most effective step to modernise it is to upgrade the database and shift it into the cloud.
