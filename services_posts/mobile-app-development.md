# <i class="fas fa-code icon-mobile-app"></i> Mobile App Development

Elegant, clean and functional mobile apps.

## A new area of development

Developing mobile apps is new territory for me but it's actually a natural extension to my existing technical skill set.

It's a whole lot of fun!  

 I've completed one app (see below) and I am about to start working on another. My plan is to build up some reusable components so that in the future I can whizz out apps with some great functionality for a very competitive price.

## Roll up, roll up, get yer cheap app ere :)

If you would like an app at a reduced rate whilst I build up a portfolio get in contact now!!

Send me an email telling me all about your app desires: [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}})
