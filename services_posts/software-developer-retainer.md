# <i class="fas fa-code icon-retainer" ></i> Software developer retainer

An affordable way for a small business to retain the services of a software developer to do small amounts of work them every month.

## Who is the retainer for

It's ideally suited to a business that has a bespoke software system or website that is more or less stable but could do with someone to do fix issues or add new features.

## Why a retainer is good

Programming and advances in computing are never ending. It seems
there is always
something that needs implementing, fixing or re-writing. That can
make maintaining bespoke software really expensive. Sticking to the
monthly retainer package will help constrain your
spending and encourage
you to prioritize what work really needs to be done.

This entitles you to up to 8 hours programming
and consultancy a month. It's fantastic value!

## What a retainer can be used for

Use it to:

- Perform maintenance
- Fix issues
- Program new features and enhancements
- Keep on top of migration and upgrades
- Carry out research and feasibility studies
- Project manage 3rd party development work
