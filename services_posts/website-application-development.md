# <i class="far fa-window-maximize icon-dev" ></i> Dynamic Web Based Applications

I've worked on many major websites over the years and I've also developed quite a few of my own. I develop web applications in Java full stack, Javascript full stack and also SPAs in ReactJS.

I generally work along side web designers who take care of all the visuals (graphics). Left to do the visuals myself I develop clean functional websites (using Bootstrap).

## What I can do for small businesses and start ups

I can help you if you have a requirement to develop a website with "lots of programming"  e.g. a website that has features such as full authentication (sign up/sign in), members only area, user profiles, message systems, data admin panels etc etc

## My website backends power mobile apps

The backend of any dynamic website I develop will also be able to power a mobile app. This means you can get a mobile app done as well for a great combined price.
