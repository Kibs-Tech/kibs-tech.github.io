# Hire a workload relief contract developer

In many cases an experienced contract developer
will be comfortably up and running within a day 
and will soon be
 ploughing through your issue log and 
 helping to alleviate the workload of your 
stressed out dev teams. If it's an all hands on 
deck situation they can also help out with all aspects of
 testing.

## Main supported technology stacks

Enterprise Java full stack with web FE, JavaScript full stack (ReactJS/NodeJS), Firebase and AWS.

## Some clients I have contracted for

- National Trust
- J.D. Williams (Simply Be, Jacamo, Marisota)
- Capgemini (HMRC)
- Littlewoods
- CAPITA (Criminal Records Bureau)
- Tyco Electronics
- CSE Servlec
- Ericsson (Sweden)
- Seagate Software (Ipswich/Vancouver)
- Retek (London/Minneapolis)
- Siemens
- Connect Digital Media (Jaguar/Land Rover)
- EMT (Spain)
