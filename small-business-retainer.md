# Small business software developer package

From just Â£200/month 

This entitles you to up to 8/hours programming
and consultancy a month. It's fantastic value!

Use it to:

- Perform maintenance 
- Fix bugs
- Perfom migration and upgrades
- Program new features
- Carry out research and feasibility studies
- Project manage 3rd party development work.


Programming is never ending. There's always 
something that seems to meed doing and that can 
make it really expensive! Sticking to the 
monthly retainer package will constrain your 
spending and help prioritize what work 
really needs doing.
