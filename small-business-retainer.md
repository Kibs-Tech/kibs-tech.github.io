# Small business software developer package

From just Â£200/month 

This entitles you to up to 8/hours programming
and consultancy a month. It's fantastic value!

Use it to:

- Perform maintenance 
- Fix issue
- Keep on top of migration and upgrades
- Program new features and enhancements
- Carry out research and feasibility studies
- Project manage 3rd party development work

## Who is the package for
A business that has a more or less stable system but could do with someone 
to keep on top of it and do small amounts of work on it

## Why a retainer is good
Programming and advances in computing is never ending. It seems 
there's always 
something that needs doing. That can 
make it really expensive! Sticking to the 
monthly retainer package will help constrain your 
spending and perhaps more importantly encourage 
you to prioritize what work really needs doing.
