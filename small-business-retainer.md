# Software developer retainer scheme

From just Â£300/month 

This entitles you to up to 8 hours programming
and consultancy a month. It's fantastic value!

Use it to:

- Perform maintenance 
- Fix issues
- Program new features and enhancements
- Keep on top of migration and upgrades
- Carry out research and feasibility studies
- Project manage 3rd party development work

## Who is the package for?
It's ideally suited to a business that has a bespoke software system or website that is more or less stable but could do with someone 
to keep on top of it as well as do small amounts of work on it.

## Why a retainer is good
Programming and advances in computing is never ending. It seems 
there is always 
something that needs implementing, fixing or re-writing. That can 
make maintaining bespoke software really expensive. Sticking to the 
monthly retainer package will help constrain your 
spending and encourage 
you to prioritize what work really needs to be done.
