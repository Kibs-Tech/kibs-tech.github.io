# Computer Services for Individuals, Sole Traders and Small Start Ups

I'm Helen, aka The IT Lady. I look after the IT needs of individuals, sole traders and small businesses.

After many years of computing experience I firmly believe in the the company moto which is: Keep It Bl**dy Simple (kibs!)

I like it simple which is lucky because so too do most plummers, handymen and hairdressers.  I can do complicated if you prefer but simple is definitely better.
